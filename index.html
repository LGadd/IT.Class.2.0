                As I move on to new opportunities, I want to leave you with some advice: 
                Always pursue what you enjoy, but don't shy away from the less exciting yet crucial parts of learning. 
                Every skill and piece of knowledge contributes to your growth and success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Embrace challenges and strive to be curious. Independent study is a superpower—use it wisely!
